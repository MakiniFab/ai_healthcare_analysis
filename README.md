AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis üè•ü§ñ
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning model for medical image analysis, specifically for detecting tumors from simulated medical images. The model uses RandomForestClassifier to classify images as either "Tumor detected" or "No tumor detected."

Features
Simulates medical image data using random pixel values.
Trains a RandomForestClassifier to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor images.
Predicts tumor presence in new simulated images.
Uses AI for medical diagnostics, showcasing how AI can assist in healthcare.

Technologies Used
Python 

NumPy (for data simulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning)

Installation & Setup
# 1 Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai_healthcare_analysis.git
cd ai_healthcare_analysis
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy scikit-learn
Run the AI Model
Execute the Python script to analyze a new medical image:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ai_medical_analysis.py
Code Explanation
Simulating Medical Image Data
The dataset consists of 100 medical images, each represented by 256 features (simulated pixel values).

Labels: 0 (Healthy), 1 (Tumor)

Training the AI Model
Uses RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn.

Trains the model on the simulated dataset.

Predicting Tumor Presence
Generates a new simulated image and predicts whether a tumor is present.

Prints "Tumor detected!" or "No tumor detected." based on prediction.

Example Output
bash
Copy
Edit
Tumor detected!
or

bash
Copy
Edit
No tumor detected.
